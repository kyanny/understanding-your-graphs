# “Understanding your graphs” mini-series for GitHub Enterprise Server administrators, rescued.

Essentially, this repository is a pointer to the [“Understanding your graphs” mini-series](https://web.archive.org/web/20201025160530/https://github.community/c/github-original-series/github-enterprise-best-practices/36) GitHub Community posts.

Since GitHub [launched](https://github.blog/2022-07-26-launching-github-community-powered-by-github-discussions/) the new [GitHub Community](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions), the old forum posts became unreachable. They are still accessible on web.archive.org as long as you knows the URL. So I collected the URLs here.

Unfortunately, one of the posts are not available on web.archive.org. So that the part 5 a missing number.

Opening web.archive.org URL is slow, and some of the graph images in the posts are broken. So I salvaged them and create a copy of them in this repository (see *Salvaged posts* section).
